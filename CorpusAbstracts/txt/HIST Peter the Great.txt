Peter the Great (1672-1725), born Petr Alekseevich Romanov, was Tsar, later Emperor, of Russia from 1682 until his death in 1725, co-reigning with his half-brother, Ivan V, from 1682 to 1696. Peter the Great's influence on Russian society and culture cannot be overstated. By shifting Russia's "eye" toward Europe, Peter the Great forever divided his nation's history into periods of "before" and "after" his reign. His reforms not only impacted how the Russian elite talked and dressed, but also how art, literature, religion, science, and architecture developed in the country. Although he remains a polarizing figure, Peter the Great's reign is undeniably one of the great turning points in Russian history. His major achievements include the founding of St. Petersburg in 1703, the victory against Sweden at the Battle of Poltava in 1709, and the birth of the Russian navy, Peter's lifelong passion.
